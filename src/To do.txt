Finish PIPEIN.  Have it run off of a data base or something
else so that the blocks do not have to be hard coded into
the program.

Create a good double line ductwork program.  Draws double lines
corners and tees.  Should know when you turn a corner to draw
a corner symbol.  Include transitions.  Should check for 
existing blocks that are required and if they don't exist
it should create them.

Reprogram INs to read layers from a data base and insert them
on the correct layers.

Setup notes so that a return at the point where it is asking
for the start point of the leader will void the leader and
insert a block only.  Setup notes to run off of a database
or something similar.

Finish UNMIRROR to work on attributes

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Establish layer conventions for use with INs and for the setup
routine.
